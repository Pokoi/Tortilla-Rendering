# Tortilla Rendering

Custom rendering model for [TortillaEngine](https://github.com/Pokoi/TortillaEngine)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Some Microsoft Visual Studio projects are given for development and testing. [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/es/) must be installed to compile the project.

All the needed libraries are included in the projects.


### Installing

If you don`t have git in your machine you can follow the steps given in the [git site](https://git-scm.com/).  

Once you have git installed, you can download the repo by command line typing the following line:

```
git clone https://github.com/Pokoi/Tortilla-Rendering.git
```

And that's it. No more steps are needed.


## Compiling the project and modifying it

Into the ``` \Rendering\projects ``` folder, some Visual Studio projects are given.  
The projects dependencies are included in the project settings. The code is divided in ``` headers ``` and ``` sources ``` filters/folders.  

## Data model explanation

The render model includes the following data model structure:  
ü•î *View*: A class that contains the scene to render info. This class keeps the camera, rasterizer, lights and models references. Also contains the ambient color (if exists).    
ü•ö *Camera*: The object with the camera information (transformation matrix, projection matrix).    
üßÖ *Model*: A model contains the information about 3D model with at least 1 mesh, it's vertices coordinates, normals and materials.    
ü•î *Mesh*: A mesh contains the indices references and the material of the mesh.    
ü•ö *Lighting*: Tortilla Rendering model supports two types of lights: directional lights and point lights.   
üßÖ *Material*: Materials contains the info about diffuse color and the factor components of ambience, diffuse and light for rendering.  

For more documentation, check [the doc](https://pokoi.github.io/Tortilla-Rendering/).  

## Supported features

ü•î 3D .obj assets loading  
ü•ö Dynamic lighting  
üßÖ Dynamic models  
ü•î Dynamic camera  
ü•ö Scene hierarchy graph  
üßÖ Polygon clipping  
ü•î Dithering post-processing efect (optional, not a requisite for render)

## Built With

ü•î [TinyObjLoader](https://github.com/tinyobjloader/tinyobjloader) - For .obj mesh assets loading.  
ü•ö [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) - For window events in the test. This doesn't affect to the render model.  
üßÖ [Cpp toolkit](https://bitbucket.org/angel-esne/cpp-toolkit/src/default/) - For maths operations and data models.  
ü•î [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) - Only used to change the window pixel-buffer, not for rendering operations.
